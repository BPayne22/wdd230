        <p1>Hicks Law - states that the more choices a person is presented with, the longer the person will take to reach a decision.
             Named after psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, Hick’s Law finds frequent application in user experience (UX) design—namely, to avoid 
             overwhelming users with too many choices, thereby keeping them engaged.</p1>
        <p2>The entire goal of youtube music is to essentially take the need for choice out of the algorithm for its user. So as the user is liking songs they 
            enjoy and skipping ones they don't Youtube music will attempt to create playlists that said user will enjoy and with one click upon opening the app 
            the music they enjoy is playing. </p2>
